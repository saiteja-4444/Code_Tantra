# 1.1.1. What is a computer programming language?
◻ Only those who study Computer Science Engineering or a related subject in college can learn and write computer programs.

✅ The sequence of instructions (in the form of source code) written in a computer programming language is called a computer program.

◻ One needs to be a genius in Maths to become a computer programmer.

◻ Computer Programming languages are very hard to learn.


# 1.1.2. The genesis of Python
◻ Python programming language was developed in the year 1999.

◻ Python is a middle-level programming language.

✅ The Python programming language evolved through many versions.

◻ Python language was created by Sundar Pichai.
# 1.1.3. Python Program Life Cycle
◻ Python programs can be executed only by writing them into files.

✅ Python source code is written and saved in a file with .py extension.

◻ Runtime errors are like grammatical errors in English.
# 1.1.4. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

◻ In Python intermediate code is generated.


✅ Compiler takes entire block of code as a single unit to check and identify the errors in program.


◻ Memory allocation is more in Python due to creation of Object code at the time of source code compilation.
# 1.1.5. High level language categories

◻ Concurrent Programming is technique that provides execution of operations sequentially.



✅ XML is an example of markup programming language.



✅ Scripting languages are used to automate frequently executing tasks.



◻ A compiled programming language is one which interprets and executes statement before the next statement is interpreted.



✅ Functional programming language uses conditional expressions and recursion to perform computation.




# 1.1.6. Identify the Error


```python
print("Python is Easy")
```

# 1.1.7. Identify the Error


```python
print("Python is not Typhoon")
```

# 1.1.8. Other usages of print function


```python
n = int(input())
print("Abracadabra"*n)
```

# 1.1.9. Fill in the missing code


```python
print("where", "the" "re", "is", "a", "will,", "there", "is", "a", "way")
```

# 1.1.10. Features of Python
✅ Python is an interpreted language.

✅ A Python program can execute C and C++ programs also.

◻ Sending an email is not possible by using Python.

✅ A Python program written on Windows operating system will also execute on Linux operating system as it is portable.
